## Schrödinger's Cat Experiment

### Historical Background

In 1935, Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger proposed one of the most famous thought experiments in quantum physics. Having developed the wave equation in 1926 that placed quantum theory on firm mathematical ground, Schrödinger was troubled by its interpretation and created this paradox to illustrate the problem.

### The Thought Experiment

A cat is placed in a sealed box along with:
- A radioactive atom
- A radiation detector
- A vial of poison
- A mechanism that releases the poison if radiation is detected

**The Quantum Paradox:**

Before observation, quantum mechanics states that the radioactive atom exists in a **superposition**—simultaneously decayed and not decayed. If the atom is in superposition, then the entire system, including the cat, must also be in superposition: **both alive and dead at the same time**.

Only when we open the box and observe does the quantum system "collapse" to a single definite state—the cat becomes either alive or dead, but not both.

### What This Teaches Us

This thought experiment demonstrates:
- **Quantum Superposition**: Particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Observation forces a quantum system to choose a definite state
- **The Measurement Problem**: The role of observation in determining reality
- **Quantum Uncertainty**: We cannot know the outcome until we observe

### Why It Matters

Schrödinger's Cat illustrates the bizarre implications of quantum mechanics when applied to everyday objects. While superposition is accepted for atoms and particles, applying it to macroscopic objects like cats reveals the counterintuitive nature of quantum physics.

This paradox remains central to discussions about quantum interpretation, measurement, and the boundary between quantum and classical physics.
